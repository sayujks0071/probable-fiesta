## Current Status

### Running Strategies
All three NIFTY/BANKNIFTY strategies are **RUNNING**:

| Strategy | PID | Symbol | Status | Uptime |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| supertrend_vwap_strategy | 42758 | BANKNIFTY | ✅ Running | ~2 min |
| ai_hybrid_reversion_breakout | 42859 | NIFTY | ✅ Running | ~2 min |
| advanced_ml_momentum_strategy | 42985 | NIFTY | ✅ Running | ~2 min |

---

## API Connectivity Test

**Test Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Tested API call: `NIFTY` on `NSE_INDEX` exchange
- Response: HTTP 200 OK
- Data received: 6 rows of historical data
- **Retry logic is working correctly**

---

## Log Monitoring Status

### Current Logging Setup
- Strategies are running with output redirected to `/dev/null`
- This means we cannot see their stdout/stderr logs directly
- Python logging module output is also being suppressed

### Available Log Sources
1. **httpx library logs**: Showing successful API calls (HTTP 200 OK)
2. **debug.log**: Contains order placement logs (MCX strategies)
3. **Old log files**: Previous runs show errors that have been fixed

### What We Can See
- ✅ API calls are succeeding (httpx logs show HTTP 200 OK)
- ✅ No timeout errors in recent httpx logs
- ✅ Strategies are running and making API calls every ~60 seconds
- ⚠️ Cannot see strategy-specific logs (RSI, signals, entry conditions)

---

## Recommendations for Better Monitoring

### Option 1: Redirect Output to Log Files
Restart strategies with log file redirection:
```bash
# Instead of > /dev/null 2>&1, use:
> /path/to/logs/strategy_name_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1
```

### Option 2: Use Python Logging to File
Modify strategies to log to files:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler(f'logs/{strategy_name}.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

### Option 3: Monitor via Process Activity
Check if processes are actively making API calls:
```bash
# Monitor network activity
lsof -p 42758 42859 42985 | grep -i tcp
```

---

## Recent Activity Analysis

### API Calls (from httpx logs)
- **Frequency**: Every ~60 seconds (as expected)
- **Status**: All returning HTTP 200 OK
- **No timeouts**: Retry logic appears to be working
- **Exchange**: Using NSE_INDEX for indices (correct)

### Order Activity
- **MCX Strategies**: Active (GOLD trading - 12+ orders today)
- **NIFTY Strategies**: No orders yet (may be waiting for entry conditions)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Logging**: Restart strategies with proper log file redirection
2. **Monitor Entry Conditions**: Check if strategies are generating signals
3. **Verify Indicators**: Confirm RSI, VWAP, ROC calculations are working
4. **Check Market Hours**: Ensure strategies are running during market hours

## Quick Health Check

```bash
# Check if strategies are alive
ps aux | grep -E "(supertrend|ai_hybrid|advanced_ml)" | grep -v grep

# Test API connectivity
python3 -c "from openalgo.strategies.utils.trading_utils import APIClient; client = APIClient('API_KEY', 'http://127.0.0.1:5001'); df = client.history('NIFTY', 'NSE_INDEX', '15m', '2026-01-29', '2026-01-29'); print(f'Got {len(df)} rows')"

# Monitor network activity
netstat -an | grep 5001 | grep ESTABLISHED
```
